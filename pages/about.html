        <p>&nbsp;Vivian Tran collapses distance.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The experience of distance is multidimensional, spanning physical space, 
          time, generations, cultures, language, socio-economic conditions, traumas, 
          and relationships. Through an&nbsp; individual property, Tran joins 
          materials which appear to be scattered by these facets of distance. Videos 
          share a single moment in time. A family shares a household. Parents share 
          a bed. Their distance from one another becomes connective. It is not a 
          separation, it is a mutual truth. Like two people becoming carefully 
          reacquainted, components within individual works learn to occupy the same 
          space. It is a slow remembering of shared identity. Tran combines personal 
          and global archival material in order to contextualize her history within 
          history. Her life within human life.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Vivian Tran does not create connection, she creates consciousness. She 
            illuminates the pre-existing structure of reality. The world was never 
            scattered. Time is not random. Tranâ€™s formulaic practice functions as a 
            prism through which information is filtered like light, clarifying its 
            true dimensions.&nbsp;</p>
